# Planwise

Planwise is an AI-powered scheduler app designed to help users plan their day effortlessly through voice input and intelligent scheduling. Instead of wasting mental energy manually structuring their day - only to end up overwhelmed and unproductive - users can simply speak their plans, and Planwise will do the rest.
<br /><br />
By leveraging AI, Planwise prevents overload, prioritises tasks intelligently, and adapts schedules based on individual productivity patterns and workload capacity. Unlike traditional calendars that merely record events, Planwise functions as a proactive personal productivity assistant, helping users focus on what truly matters while avoiding burnout.
